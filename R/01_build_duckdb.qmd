# Introduction

This notebook builds the DuckDB database & base tables from scratch. Everything not in this file is built via the scrapes later in the pipeline.

# Initialize

These are the core packages needed to rebuild the database. We will use other packages, but they are going to be in the relevant code-chunks to show the association.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages

library(DBI)
library(duckdb)
library(tidyverse)
```

I'm using [DuckDB](%22https://duckdb.org/%22) for this project because flat files are annoying and DuckDB is light-weight and very easy to use.

```{r}
#| label: db-connect

con = dbConnect(duckdb(), "database.duckdb")
dbListTables(con) |> as_tibble_col("tables")
```

# Tables

This project uses various data sources

## Zip Codes

A lot of the addresses from the scrapes are non-standard, so this table of zip codes will help standardize the results. [zipcodeR]() makes it very easy to obtain tibbles of zip codes and relevant information, but it does use `<glob>` storage of `<raw>` values which was new for me. Shout out to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77285606/26439015) Stack Overflow answer for suggesting the `jsonlite::parse_gzjson_raw()` solution.

```{r}
#| label: zip-codes

library(zipcodeR)
library(jsonlite)

zip_codes = search_state("WV") |> 
  select(zipcode, major_city, cities = common_city_list, county) |>
  mutate(cities = map(cities, parse_gzjson_raw)) |> 
  unnest_longer(cities) |> 
  summarize(
    .by = c(zipcode, major_city, county), 
    cities = str_c(cities, collapse = "|"))

dbWriteTable(con, "zip_codes", zip_codes)
dbListTables(con)
```

## Travel Regions

The WV Tourism website designated 9 different regions to the counties of WV as Travel Regions. I hate to admit it, but as these aren't **official** in anyway, I just had to make this table by hand.

```{r}
#| label: travel-regions

travel_regions = tribble(
  ~region,                         ~county,

dbWriteTable(con, "travel_regions", travel_regions)

# Finalize
Finally, we disconnect from the DB.

```{r}
#| label: db-disconnect

dbDisconnect(con)
